Amazon Web Services (AWS) offers a vast array of cloud services to cater to diverse IT and business needs. Some of the most common and widely used AWS services include:

Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud): Provides resizable virtual servers (instances) for running applications. It's a fundamental service for hosting a wide range of applications.

Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service): Offers scalable object storage for storing and retrieving data, including documents, images, videos, and backups.

Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service): Manages relational databases, including popular databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQL Server, making it easier to set up, operate, and scale.

Amazon Lambda: Allows you to run code in response to events, without the need to manage servers. It's a core service for building serverless applications.

Amazon VPC (Virtual Private Cloud): Provides a private, isolated network environment within AWS, allowing you to launch resources like EC2 instances into your own virtual network.

Amazon SNS (Simple Notification Service): Enables pub/sub messaging for distributing messages and notifications to various endpoints, including email, SMS, and Lambda functions.

Amazon SQS (Simple Queue Service): Offers a fully managed message queue service that decouples distributed applications.

Amazon DynamoDB: A fully managed NoSQL database service designed for high availability, scalability, and low-latency performance.

Amazon API Gateway: Facilitates the creation, publishing, and management of APIs for serverless and traditional applications.

Amazon CloudFront: A content delivery network (CDN) service that distributes content globally, reducing latency and improving the performance of web applications.

Amazon Route 53: A scalable and highly available DNS (Domain Name System) web service for domain registration and routing traffic to resources.

AWS IAM (Identity and Access Management): Enables you to control access to AWS services and resources by defining users, roles, and permissions.

AWS CloudFormation: Allows you to define and provision AWS infrastructure as code, making it easier to manage and automate resource deployment.

AWS CloudWatch: Provides monitoring, logging, and alerting services to gain insights into the performance and health of AWS resources and applications.

AWS S3 Glacier: Offers long-term archival storage at a low cost for data that doesn't require immediate access.

AWS Elastic Beanstalk: Simplifies the deployment and management of applications by providing a platform as a service (PaaS) environment.

Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service): Manages the orchestration of containerized applications using Kubernetes.

AWS Glue: Provides fully managed ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) services for data preparation and integration.

Amazon Redshift: A fully managed data warehousing service designed for analytics and business intelligence.

AWS Lambda Layers: Allows you to centrally manage code libraries and dependencies for Lambda functions.

These are just a subset of the extensive AWS service catalog. The choice of services depends on your specific use case, and AWS provides a wide range of tools to meet various requirements in terms of compute, storage, databases, analytics, machine learning, and more.
