# Event-Driven Architecture and Serverless
**Event-Driven Architectures (EDAs)** and serverless computing are two concepts that often go hand in hand, as they complement each other well. Let's break down each concept and then discuss how they relate in the context of serverless computing:

## Event-Driven Architecture (EDA):
- In an Event-Driven Architecture, the flow of the system is determined by events such as user actions, sensor outputs, or system alerts.
- Events are occurrences or changes in a system that can be captured, processed, and responded to in real-time.
- Components in an EDA communicate through events, and each component can act as a producer, consumer, or both.
- This architecture is highly scalable and flexible, making it suitable for systems where responsiveness and adaptability to changing conditions are crucial.

## Serverless Computing:
- Serverless computing, despite its name, does not mean there are no servers involved. Instead, it refers to the abstraction of server management, allowing developers to focus on writing code without dealing with server provisioning, maintenance, or scaling.
- Serverless platforms, like AWS Lambda, ~~Azure Functions~~, or ~~Google Cloud Functions~~, execute functions in response to events without the need for a dedicated server instance.
- Billing in serverless is typically based on the actual compute resources consumed during the function execution, rather than pre-allocated resources.

## Event-Driven Architectures in the context of Serverless:
- Serverless computing platforms are inherently event-driven. Functions (serverless units of execution) are triggered by events such as HTTP requests, database changes, file uploads, or custom events.
- Events are the backbone of serverless applications, defining when and how functions should be executed. For example, a function might be triggered by an HTTP request, process the request, and produce an event that triggers another function to store the result in a database.
- EDAs enhance the serverless paradigm by providing a natural way to structure the flow of serverless applications. Functions become event consumers and producers, reacting to changes in the system in a decoupled and scalable manner.
- With serverless and event-driven architectures combined, developers can build highly scalable, responsive, and efficient applications that automatically scale based on demand. This combination is particularly powerful for applications with unpredictable workloads or sporadic bursts of activity.

In summary, **Event-Driven Architectures** and serverless computing are complementary paradigms that together enable the development of highly scalable, loosely coupled, and responsive applications. The combination is well-suited for modern, cloud-native applications that require flexibility and efficient resource utilization.

## Producers, Consumers and Routers
**EDAs** are dynamic and responsive systems built upon three key components: **event producers**, **event consumers**, and **event routers**. These components form the backbone of EDAs, orchestrating the flow of information and actions within the system. Together, these components enable the creation of scalable, decoupled, and highly adaptable systems, where communication and actions are driven by the dynamic nature of events.

### Producers
**Event producers** are components or entities that generate and emit events in an event-driven system. The events are initiated based on specific triggers or changes in a system, e.g. in response to user actions, system updates, external data changes or other relevant occurances. In the context of serverless and AWS, producers are often __functions__ or __services__ that produce events in response to specific events they receive or changes they detect. Typical producers for AWS can include services such as __AWS Lambda__, __Amazon S3 (for object creation events)__, and __AWS CloudWatch (for monitoring and logging events)__. 

### Consumers
**Event consumers** are components or entities that subscribe to and react to events generated by producers. They listen for and respond to events that are relevant to their functionality or purpose. In the context of serverless and AWS, consumers are typically functions or services that are triggered by specific events and are executed in response. AWS services like __AWS Lambda__ are commonly used as event consumers in serverless architectures as they can be configured to to respond to specific events from various AWS services or custom events. Typical tasks for consumers are to process data, update databases, send notifications or trigger other events in a cascading fashion.

### Routers
**Event routers** are components or entities responsible for directing the flow of events from producers to consumers in an EDA. Their primary function is to ensure that events are efficiently and appropriately delivered to the intended recipients. Event routers act as intermediaries, facilitating the communication between event producers and event consumers without them needing direct knowledge of each other. In other words, they act as traffic controllers for events in an EDA. AWS offer two main types of routers: (1) **Amazon EventBride** and (2) **Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS)**. **Amazon EventBride** is used to build event buses which allow you use predefined schemas for events and to create rules that are applied across the entire event body to filter before pushing to consumers. **Amazon SNS** on the other hand uses SNS topics that are agnostic to the event schema coming through and is recommended when building an application with high throughput or for applications with a high number of endpoints.
