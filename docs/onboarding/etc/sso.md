AWS Single Sign-On (SSO) is a fully managed service by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that simplifies access management for AWS accounts and business applications. AWS SSO allows users to sign in once and access multiple AWS accounts and third-party applications without the need to remember multiple usernames and passwords. Here are the key features and components of AWS SSO:

Single Sign-On: AWS SSO provides users with a single set of credentials (username and password) to access AWS accounts and integrated business applications. This eliminates the need for multiple login credentials, streamlining the sign-in process.

Centralized User Management: AWS SSO offers centralized user and group management, allowing administrators to create and manage user identities within AWS SSO. Users can be organized into groups to simplify permission assignments.

Integration with AWS Accounts: AWS SSO seamlessly integrates with AWS accounts. Users and groups created within AWS SSO can be associated with AWS accounts, allowing users to assume roles in those accounts without the need for additional IAM user credentials.

Integration with SAML 2.0: AWS SSO supports Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) 2.0, a standard for exchanging authentication and authorization data. This enables integration with a wide range of third-party applications that support SAML-based Single Sign-On.

Pre-integrated Applications: AWS SSO provides a gallery of pre-integrated SAML-based applications, making it easier to set up Single Sign-On for commonly used applications such as Salesforce, Microsoft 365, and Slack.

Custom Application Integration: Administrators can also configure AWS SSO to work with custom applications or applications that are not in the pre-integrated gallery.

Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): AWS SSO supports MFA, adding an extra layer of security for user authentication.

Managed Policies: AWS SSO offers managed policies that administrators can attach to groups to define permissions for AWS services and integrated applications.

Audit and Logging: Administrators can review user sign-in activity, including the source IP address, user agent, and timestamp, in the AWS SSO console. Audit logs provide visibility into user activities.

User Portal: AWS SSO provides a user portal where users can access their assigned AWS accounts and integrated applications with a single sign-in experience.

Customization: The user portal can be customized with branding and company logos to provide a consistent and familiar look and feel for users.

Regional Availability: AWS SSO is available in multiple AWS regions to accommodate global deployments.

AWS SSO simplifies the management of user access to AWS accounts and applications, enhances security through centralized authentication and authorization, and improves user productivity by reducing the need for multiple login credentials. It is particularly valuable for organizations with multiple AWS accounts and third-party applications to manage.
