# APIs

APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) are fundamental to modern software development, especially in serverless and cloud-based architectures. They enable different software systems to communicate and exchange data efficiently.

In the context of AWS serverless, understanding how to design, implement, and secure APIs is crucial for building robust and scalable applications.

This section will introduce you to key concepts and best practices in API development and security within the serverless ecosystem.
