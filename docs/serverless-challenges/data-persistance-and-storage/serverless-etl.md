# Simple Serverless ETL

### Challenge Level: 2

In this challenge, you'll implement a simple Serverless ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process using AWS services. This pattern is crucial for processing and moving data between different storage and processing systems in a scalable and cost-effective manner.

## Challenge Description

Your task is to design and implement a serverless ETL pipeline that extracts data from a source, performs some transformations, and loads the processed data into a destination. This pipeline should be able to handle varying loads and scale automatically.

## Technical Requirements

1. Use Amazon S3 as the source for raw data files (CSV format)
2. Implement an AWS Lambda function to be triggered when new files are uploaded to S3
3. Use the Lambda function to read the file, perform simple transformations (e.g., data type conversions, filtering)
4. Store the processed data in Amazon DynamoDB
5. Implement error handling and logging using CloudWatch Logs
6. Set up CloudWatch Events to trigger the ETL process on a schedule (in addition to S3 triggers)
7. Implement basic data validation before loading into DynamoDB
8. Use AWS Glue (optional) for more complex transformations if needed
9. Set up monitoring and alerting for the ETL process using CloudWatch Alarms
10. Ensure the solution is scalable to handle increasing data volumes

## Hints

::: details Hint 1: S3 Event Notifications
To trigger your Lambda function when new files are uploaded:
- Configure S3 Event Notifications on your bucket
- Set up the appropriate permissions for S3 to invoke your Lambda function
- Consider using S3 object key prefixes to organize your data and trigger specific processes
:::

::: details Hint 2: Data Transformation in Lambda
When performing transformations in Lambda:
- Use libraries like Pandas for data manipulation if dealing with structured data
- Implement modular code for different transformation steps to improve maintainability
- Consider memory and time limits of Lambda functions when processing large files
:::

::: details Hint 3: Efficient DynamoDB Loading
To efficiently load data into DynamoDB:
- Use batch write operations to minimize the number of API calls
- Design your DynamoDB table schema to support efficient querying for your use case
- Consider using DynamoDB Streams if you need to trigger actions based on data changes
:::

::: details Hint 4: Error Handling and Monitoring
Implement robust error handling and monitoring:
- Use try-except blocks to catch and handle errors gracefully
- Log relevant information for debugging and monitoring
- Set up CloudWatch Alarms to alert on failures or abnormal conditions (e.g., high latency, error rates)

## Quiz

<Quiz 
  question="What is the primary advantage of using a serverless architecture for ETL processes?"
  :answers="['Lower cost for continuous high-volume processing', 'Automatic scaling to handle varying loads', 'Simplified data transformation logic', 'Reduced data latency']"
  :correctAnswer="1"
  :answerInfo="[
    'Serverless can be more cost-effective for intermittent processing, but may not be cheaper for continuous high-volume workloads.',
    'Correct! A key advantage of serverless ETL is automatic scaling to handle varying loads without managing infrastructure.',
    'While serverless can simplify some aspects, it doesn\'t inherently simplify transformation logic.',
    'Serverless doesn\'t necessarily reduce data latency compared to other architectures.'

<Quiz 
  question="Which AWS service is commonly used to trigger Lambda functions when new files are uploaded to S3?"
  :answers="['CloudWatch Events', 'S3 Event Notifications', 'SNS', 'SQS']"
  :correctAnswer="1"
  :answerInfo="[
    'While CloudWatch Events can be used to schedule ETL processes, it\'s not typically used for S3 upload notifications.',
    'Correct! S3 Event Notifications are commonly used to trigger Lambda functions when new files are uploaded to S3.',
    'SNS can be part of an event-driven architecture, but S3 Event Notifications are more direct for this use case.',
    'SQS is a queuing service and isn\'t directly used for S3 upload notifications.'

  question="What is a benefit of using DynamoDB in a serverless ETL pipeline?"
  :answers="['Support for complex SQL queries', 'Automatic scaling of throughput', 'Built-in data transformation capabilities', 'Support for ACID transactions']"
  :correctAnswer="1"
  :answerInfo="[
  'DynamoDB is a NoSQL database and doesn\'t support complex SQL queries natively.',
  'Correct! DynamoDB provides automatic scaling of throughput, which aligns well with the scalability needs of serverless architectures.',
  'While DynamoDB is flexible, it doesn\'t have built-in data transformation capabilities like some ETL-specific tools.',
  'While DynamoDB supports transactions, this isn\'t its primary benefit in a serverless ETL context compared to its scalability.'

  :correctAnswer="2"
  :answerInfo="[
  'Extracting data from S3 is a common first step in a serverless ETL process.',
  'Transforming data using Lambda is a key step in serverless ETL.',
  'Correct! Real-time data streaming is not typically part of a simple serverless ETL process. While it can be incorporated in more complex architectures, it\'s not a standard component of basic ETL pipelines.',
  'Loading transformed data into DynamoDB is a common final step in a serverless ETL process.'
